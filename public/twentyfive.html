    I believe this was a cold brew from Blanchard's Morris St. location. Ask for "for here glass, please."

  <p>
    Slight coffee hiatus this week... This oolong tea was perfect for when you're at a cafe and don't want another coffee "smooth and energizing" - very ideal. They use the metal tea steeper here and have cute little timers (set to roughly 2 minutes).

    'Guinness is a stout that originated in the brewery of Arthur Guinness at St. James's Gate, Dublin, Ireland, in the 18th century.'<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness"> Wikipedia</a> <br>They say it's good paired with a light meal. I say it's best paired with a game of 8 ball and 'the lads'. (enjoy cold in a beatle's theme pub)

    For the past month I haven't had any alcohol and instead having this every night. 8 oz of tonic water and about 1 oz of lime juice and some ice (lime rind as needed). Bonus points for a bachelorette-party-energy pint glass.

    Here's a unique one - garam masala tomato soup. Took a sip before I snapped a photo. Jennie made me make a sign for this special. I had a hard time spelling it ... even still is it 'marsala' or 'masala'?

  <p>
    A great NA cocktail is what Jennie coined as a 'health' tonic. Recently, at work, I've been tasked with making tumeric, ginger, carrot juice with cayenne, black pepper, lemon, and pressed coconut water - or 'immunity shots' like at the grocery. Combined with a little tonic and you've got an excellent drink.

    Here we have our first guest appearance by french canadian, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Canadians">Cameron</a>. On the left, a frozen protein-oriented beverage containing: banana, yogurt, water, whey protein powder ("gonna buy plant based next time, I think." - cam), powdered peanut butter ("?" - your correspondence), honey.

  <p>
    An orange juice and tonic water beverage served with a mint leaf served in a Belhaven half pint glass (try Belehaven Black). Once my mother gave my grandmother a gallon freezer bag full of 'mint' leaves which were shortly returned after my grandmother accused her of giving her a bag of weeds. The legitimacy of this claim plagues my family to this day.

    Had lunch my grandfather for his 88th birthday, although he claims to be turning 'only 85'. We had Jersey Mikes at his request. Here is a photo of his Modelo and my glass of ice water. He shared with me that when he was 3-years-old and his parents had his younger brother, they then took his name and gave it to his younger brother instead and changed his name.

    I have been waiting to try this one for a while!! I forget the name but it's espresso-cola-lime-hibicus. Hard to tell in the photograph but the color of the drink was almost purple. Thank you lovely blanchard's baristas.

    Two for One! Lauren's peroni with a lemon (apparently common in 'Amalfi Coast'(american accent)) and my lime and tonic. Fired up some mexican-street-corn last saturday. Not sure how traditional it was made but this is one of the few recipes I remember from the hell hole that was casa del barco(also american accent).

    Had to snag a photo of these 2 (Iced Matcha & Iced Latte ('for here, please.')) Enjoyed on easter sunday at work. Footnote: I made an 'iced macchiato'(accent italiano (out of no where)) and forgot to snag a photo of it but it was a thing of beauty.

    Cheers! These were made by fiona for us on easter. 'green tea, coconut water, half a lemon, tonic' Lovely taste but green tea makes me wig out for some reason. I was given the blue glass "because you're a boy" - fiona.

  <p>
    Attended a wedding this weekend and this was the 'Signature Cocktail'. It was a transfusion made with vodka(roughly 2-4 oz depending on which bartender you sought), ginger beer, and grape juice served with a lime. I did not know either the groom or the bride so as you can imagine I had quite a few of these.

    Cameron and I's Old Speckled Hens enjoyed after band practice. We settled on going to The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel" >Cask</a> Cafe for drinks. This is one of my favorite beers and can only be found here and the Jasper as far as I know. We sat on the patio over looking the old street car depot which I was given a quick history lesson about via cameron after 2 of these.

  This is an orange-honey-cold-brew I made at work with oat milk. There is a bit of a debacle with how the cold brew is turning out every time I make it. I think I need to use more coffee grounds or use a different grind size.

  2 tumeric-honey-lattes I made for David and I. People always call these golden milk latte ( eye roll ). Not sure why this angers me so much. (side note) I the have copilot extension on in VS Code and it keeps auto generating reviews for the drinks in the margins. Here are some of the reviews: "The tumeric-honey-latte is a delightful blend of flavors that will leave you feeling refreshed and energized. The tumeric adds a warm, earthy flavor that is perfectly balanced by the sweetness of the honey. The latte is creamy and smooth, making it a perfect drink for any time of day." - 5 stars.

    Orange honey, orange juice, tonic water, and espresso. I think my tastebuds have finally accepted espresso-tonic combinations. As long as it is hotter than the sun outside and the drink is ice cold, I will drink it.

    My friends went to this new place on Robinson St. called "Mexican Margarita" on a Monday a couple weeks ago. We did not realize that it was also Cinco de Mayo. Here are Tal and I's drinks of choice. The walls in this place are quite literally margarita-green.

  Stumbled upon Sarah in meadow park on her way to Garnette's. I went and sat at the bar and had a WBLT and an Unsweetened Iced Tea. I followed that up with a couple kolsches and a water. I then proceeded to fall asleep on the vmfa lawn slightly inebreiated. "Garnette's is a great place to go if you want to feel like you're in a movie." This was also the night I went to Brown's Island to see Fighting Gravity play since lauren had a plus one. This was an exceptional day and I do not normally live like this.

  A miller-lite in a "very important" drink holder at the Mj Lenderman show. I was not originally going to this show, but the keyboardist for MJ and bassist for Wednesday, Ethan, came into the shop and was nice enough to put me on the guest list for the show. This gave me a VIP ticket and access to the special bar and balcony. Thank you <a href="https://ethanbaechtold.bandcamp.com/album/film-look-ep">Ethan</a>!
