    <blockquote id="quote"><i> "Fully recorded in a hand-crafted virtual environment, Lucidity is an immersive short film about identity and religion in the context of modern social hierarchies. Best viewed with a head-mounted display, the viewer follows the experiences of Claire, a security contractor hired by a multi-planetary energy corporation to install security cameras for a luxury passenger train on a far-away colonized planet. Claire is aboard the train alongside 3 corporate executives. All parties have been contractually obligated to receive a cerebral implant that allows their employer to control communication between workers. Through a series of altercations between Claire and the executives, the artificial barriers between the employees begin to crumble, and together they discover strange parts of the world that further weaken the integrity of their system. Upon discovering the home of their invisible oppressor, the party finds out what it means to be able to destroy that which has created their existence. Lucidity can be seen as a reinterpretation of the Tower of Babel. We don't see The Tower as a cautionary tale about pride in opposition to the divine, but as the misuse of power in reaction to the ability for the collective to rival said power. The dynamic between the Abrahamic god and its creation is not dissimilar to that of the secular powers at the top of our socioeconomic systems and those below them. The powers that maintain every aspect of our artificial existence are, to our mind, tangible humans, which is a markedly different relationship than one has with a theistic divine. What happens when oneâ€™s divine oppressor has a pulse? Or a power source? And that source can be unplugged?"</i>
