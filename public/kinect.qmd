## Overview
This program uses the joint-tracking of the xbox kinect to play a pure data patch within Unity. The program follows the players hands in the X and Y axis. The distance between the players hands in the X axis control the frequency of the melody while the distance in the Y axis control the frequency of the bass. The project was inspired by the theremin and other instruments controlled by movement rather than hitting a note or plucking a string. The goal was to create
sounds based on the space we occupy.
