    A trip to visit my sister Emma in Edinburgh over the summer. We took a trip up to a bee keeper cottage in the highlands! Here is my Christmas present to you Emma!

    Making these videos and Christmas in general has coincided with the mass murder of the Palestinian people and destruction of Gaza.

    The quick break from school has let me reflect on the individual's role in the United States. How can I undermine the ethnic cleansing and colonialism of the US. 

    Through making these videos and most past and on-going projects I've tried to understand my own place. I hope everyone has spent the holiday reflecting and been able to connect with family over what is going on in the world.
