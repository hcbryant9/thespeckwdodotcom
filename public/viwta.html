    <blockquote id="quote"><i> "This class explores virtual/mixed/augmented reality and 3d interactive art/research projects in a trans-disciplinary discussion of art, technology and human experience. We will dynamically explore the userâ€™s physical/psychological engagement with virtual body and space, and investigate human experience and perceptions in multiple states of self and reality. Class will have critical discussions, based on weekly research topics, as well as project productions. For the projects, students will work in groups with various roles (such as modeler, animator, programmer, sound artist, painter, writer, coordinator, video doc, etc). Students from Art and Engineering school will work together as a team, to produce transdisciplinary art/research projects. Individual projects are also possible, upon requests. The selected projects will be submitted to important venues of Electronic Arts, HCI, Game, VR Healthcare, etc."</i>
