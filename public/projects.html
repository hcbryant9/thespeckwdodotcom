    <p1>This program uses the joint-tracking of the xbox kinect to play a pure data patch within Unity. The program follows the players hands in the X and Y axis.
        The distance between the players hands in the X axis control the frequency of the bass while the distance in the Y axis control the frequency of the melody.
        The project was inspired by the theremin and other instruments controlled by movement rather than hitting a note or plucking a string. The goal was to create
        a body synthesizer that was played by the 6th sense. The body-sensation of being able to control music with our movements.
