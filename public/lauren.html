    An animation I made Lauren for Christmas this year. I used Cathodemer to create all of frames and to piece them together. Cathodemer has no undo button on the Figure tab so please let me know if anyone has a work around that. Merry Christmas Lauren, love you!

    Making these videos and Christmas in general has coincided with the mass murder of the Palestinian people and destruction of Gaza.

    The quick break from school has let me reflect on the individual's role in the United States. How can I undermine the ethnic cleansing and colonialism of the US. 

    Through making these videos and most past and on-going projects I've tried to understand my own place. I hope everyone has spent the holiday reflecting and been able to connect with family over what is going on in the world.
