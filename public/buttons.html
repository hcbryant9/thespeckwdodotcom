    I picked this up from Capitol Vintage yesterday off one of my regulars Basel. The Lipizzan (or Equus caballus) comes from what is modern day Slovenia while is was the Hapsberg Empire (1282–1918). They are known as the "ballerinas of the horse world" for their advanced manuevers caple in battle. However, the Lipizans came close to extinction while war swept through the area during World War 2. Under the direction of General George Patton, 70 white stallions were rescued during "Operation Cowboy" from the Spanish Riding School in Viena. The story has been dramatized in Walt Disney's "Miracle of the White Stallions" staring Robert Taylor as Alois Podhajsky. The Herrmann Family came to the United States in 1962 with their 3 Royal Lipizzan Horses escaping Europe. They settled in Myakka City, just east of Sarasota in Florida. The Herrmann's are now onto their 5th Generation of rider/trainers. They are still open for operation to watch these combat horses run around a muddy track in Manatee County. "The Lipizzans have performed for dignitaries, royalty, and military leaders. Now these horses perform for you". A ticket to this historic show will cost you $22 for an adult. While coolers are premitted, they ask you not to bring any alcoholic beverages. There is also a concession stand that sells hot dogs (beef), popcorn, chips, canned soda, and bottled water.

    Slight coffee hiatus this week... This oolong tea was perfect for when you're at a cafe and don't want another coffee "smooth and energizing" - very ideal. They use the metal tea steeper here and have cute little timers (set to roughly 2 minutes).
